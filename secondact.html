        <h6>THE DIABOLICAL CIRCLE _Beulah Bornstead_ </h6>
        <h6 class="name former">FORMER POOR MAN</h6>
        <p class="direction">[Frantically.]</p>
        <p class="speech"> The Judge, where is he? I must see him at once.</p>
        <h6 class="name IMP">IMP</h6>
        <p class="direction">[Yawning.]</p>
           <p class="speech">  You're too early. He isn't down yet.
            
            <p class="direction">[Settles himself to go to sleep again]</p></p>
            <h6 class="name former">FORMER POOR MAN </h6>
            <p class="direction">[Walking the floor, and holding his hands to his stomach.]</p>
           <p class="speech">  Don't go to sleep again. I'm nearly crazy. What time does the Judge get here? Where does he live? Can't we send for him?</p>
           <h6 class="name IMP">IMP</h6>
           <p class="direction">[Indifferently.]</p>
           <p class="speech">   Oh, he is liable to come any minute—and then he may not come for an hour or two.</p>
           <h6 class="name former ">FORMER POOR MAN</h6>
           <p class="direction">[Pacing the floor, moaning and rubbing his stomach.]</p>
            <p class="speech">  Oh, I can't stand it much longer. It's driving me wild, I tell you. I do wish the Judge would come.</p>
            <h6 class="name IMP">IMP</h6>
            <p class="direction"> [Getting up from his chair and keeping step with the Former Poor Man.]</p>
            <p class="speech"> What's the matter? I thought all you wanted was to eat, drink, and be merry.
                <h6 class="name former ">FORMER POOR MAN</h6>
                <p class="direction">[Frantically waving his arms.]</p>
            <p class="speech"> Eat, drink, and be merry be——! Everything I eat gives me indigestion something awful; everything I drink gives it to me worse. How can I be merry when I am in this torment all the time? I tell you this pain is driving me mad. I want to get rid of it quick. Oh, why doesn't the Judge come?</p>
            <h6 class="name IMP">IMP</h6>
            <p class="speech"> What's the Judge got to do with it?</p>
            <h6 class="name former ">FORMER POOR MAN</h6>
            <p class="direction">[Pathetically.]</p>
           <p class="speech">   I am going to beg him to take back this indigestion and give me back my poverty. It was not so bad, after all; not nearly so bad as this pain in my stomach.</p>
            
           <p class="direction"> [The street-door opens slowly, and a sorrowful woman enters.]</p> 
           <p class="speech">She is weeping softly. It is the Vain Woman. Gone is her posing and her proud manner. She walks humbly to the railing, and not seeing the Judge, she turns to Imp. The Former Poor Man looks at the Vain Woman, frowningly muttering: "What's she here for?" Then he sits down at the left and rocks back and forth in misery.</p>
           <h6 class="name vain">VAIN WOMAN</h6>
           <p class="direction">[Tearfully.]</p>
            <p class="speech"> I must see the Judge right away, please.</p>
            <h6 class="name IMP">IMP</h6>
            <p class="direction"> [Languidly.]</p>
            <p class="speech"> He isn't down yet. You're too earl——</p>
            <h6 class="name vain">VAIN WOMAN</h6> 
            <p class="direction">[Interrupting.] </p>
            <p class="speech">Tell him that it is very important, that I am in great distress and that he must see me at once.</p>
            <h6 class="name IMP">IMP</h6> 
            <p class="direction">[Loudly.]</p> 
            <p class="speech">I said that he was not down yet.</p>
            
            <p class="direction">[Seeing that she does not understand]</p>
             <p class="speech">he takes a writing-pad from his desk, scribbles a few words, and standing in front of her, holds it up for her to read.</p>
             <h6 class="name vain ">VAIN WOMAN</h6>
             <p class="direction"> [After reading.] </p>
            <p class="speech">Oh, when will he be here? Can't you get him to come right away? Oh, I am so unhappy.</p>
            
            <p class="direction">[She walks the floor in agitation.]</p>
            
           <p class="direction">[The Former Poor Man grunts in irritation and turns his back on her.</p>
           <h6  class="name vain ">VAIN WOMAN</h6>
            <p class="speech"> I cannot hear a word that is said to me. No one seems to want me around, and I am not invited out any more. I have the feeling that people are making fun of me instead of praising my beauty. Oh, it is dreadful to be deaf. [Getting hysterical.] I want the Judge to take away this deafness. I would rather have my wrinkles.</p>
            
            <p class="direction">[Imp shakes his head in pretended sympathy, saying: "Too bad, too bad."]</p>
            
            <p class="direction">[She misunderstands and cries out.]</p>
            <h6 class="name vain ">VAIN WOMAN</h6>
          <p class="speech"> Has the Judge given away my wrinkles? I want them back. I want my very own wrinkles, too. Wrinkles are distinguished-looking. [Beginning to sob.] I don't want to be deaf any longer.</p>
          <h6 class="name IMP">IMP</h6>
          <p class="direction"> [Running over to the Former Poor Man.]</p>
            <p class="speech"> Say, this lady feels very bad. Can't you cheer her up a little?</p>
            <h6 class="name former ">FORMER POOR MAN</h6>
            <p class="speech"> Who is still rocking back and forth with his own misery, looks up at Imp in disgust.] Cheer—her—up! Me? What's the joke?</p>
            
           <p class="direction"> [The Vain Woman walks to the curtained door, looks in as if seeking something, then returns to a chair, where she sits, weeping softly.]</p>
            
           <p class="speech"> A peculiar thumping is heard at the street-door. The Former Poor Man jumps to his feet in expectancy, hoping it is the Judge. Imp, also, stands waiting. The door opens as though the person that opened it did so with difficulty. The Former Rich Citizen hobbles in. He is ragged and dirty, and one foot is bandaged, which causes him to use a crutch. He carries a large milk-can. He hobbles painfully to the centre of the stage. The Former Poor Man grunts with disappointment, and sits down again, rubbing away at his stomach. The Vain Woman sits with bowed head, silently weeping. The Former Rich Citizen looks about, then addresses Imp in a rather husky voice.</p>
           <h6 class="name former ">FORMER RICH CITIZEN</h6>
            <p class="speech"> I wish to see the Judge at once. It is most urgent.</p>

            <p class="direction"> [With an ill-concealed smile.]</p>
            <p class="speech"> You can't see the Judge at once.</p>
            <h6 class="name former ">FORMER RICH CITIZEN</h6>
            <p class="direction">[Impatiently.]</p>
            <p class="speech">  Why not? I told you it was most urgent.</p>

            <p class="direction"> [Grinning openly.]</p>
            <p class="speech"> Because he isn't here. He hasn't come in yet. What's your trouble?</p>
